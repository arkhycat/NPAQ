The PBLib project page is located at
<http://tools.computational-logic.org/content/pblib.php>. You can either use the
provided binaries or compile the source code yourself. However, the source code
(following the provided instructions) seems to be missing some definitions of
`floor` and `ceil` functions so we added the `math` header in `PBConfig.h`.

We also made few changes to PBLib noted below:
- some debug prints most of which are commented out 
- forcing encoding using adder
